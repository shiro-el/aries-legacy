# Fork notes: Aries

This fork of [kosumic/whip](https://github.com/kosumic/whip) ships as **Aries**.
Each change records what changed, why, and how, so upstream merges stay easy.

## Name

Aries (the ram). herdr comes from "herder", and whip is the herder's tool; the
fork keeps the herding theme with the ram that leads the flock.

- Reuse this motif for the app icon later (Q26-7 UX redesign). The launcher
  icon is still upstream's whip icon.

## Changes

### 1. Personal application ID and launcher name

- **What:** `applicationId` is `io.github.shiroel.aries`, and the launcher label is
  "Aries".
  - `android/app/build.gradle`: `applicationId`
  - `app.json`: `name`, `android.package`
  - `android/app/src/main/res/values*/strings.xml`: `app_name`
- **Why:** It installs beside the Play Store build of whip. It also needs its own
  Firebase and EAS projects for push.
- **How:** Only `applicationId` changes. `namespace` and the Kotlin package stay
  `io.github.kaminarios.whip`, so native sources match upstream and merge cleanly.
- **Not changed yet:**
  - iOS `bundleIdentifier`: this fork targets Android only.
  - `extra.eas.projectId`, `owner`, and the relay URL.
- **Push needs separate setup:** the relay forwards Expo push tokens, and Expo
  tokens belong to an EAS project. The upstream EAS project has no FCM
  credentials for this package. See change 2.
- **Known side effect:** both apps register the `whip://` scheme, so Android may ask
  which app opens such links.

### 2. Own push stack and signing key

- **What:** Aries uses its own Firebase project, EAS project, notify relay, and
  upload signing key.
  - `app.json`: `slug` is `aries`, `owner` is `jae0406`, and
    `extra.eas.projectId` points to the `@jae0406/aries` EAS project.
  - `notify-relay/cloudflare.config.ts`, `notify-relay/wrangler.jsonc`: the
    account is our own, the Worker is `aries-notify`, the D1 database is
    `aries-notify`, and the domain is `notify.aries.shiroel.com`.
- **Why:** Push from upstream's stack can't reach a different application ID
  (see change 1).
- **How:**
  - Firebase project `aries-1857d` registers `io.github.shiroel.aries`.
  - The service account `aries-expo-push` holds only the
    *Firebase Cloud Messaging API Admin* role. Its FCM V1 key is stored in Expo
    only and is not kept on the build server.
  - Expo's credential flow requires an Android upload keystore, so it holds a
    throwaway placeholder keystore. Aries never signs with it; don't use EAS
    cloud builds without replacing it.
  - Build inputs live outside the repo in `~/.config/aries/` (0700). Source
    `aries.env` before building:
    - `WHIP_GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON`
    - `WHIP_NOTIFY_RELAY_URL`
    - `WHIP_UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_PROPERTIES`, which points to the `aries-upload.p12`
      signing key. Back this key up: losing it means reinstalling and losing
      app data.

    ```sh
    set -a; . ~/.config/aries/aries.env; set +a
    nix develop -c sh -c 'cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease -Pwhip.skipR8=true -PreactNativeArchitectures=arm64-v8a'
    ```
  - Relay deploy: `(cd notify-relay && nix develop .. -c npx cf deploy)`. Apply new
    migrations first with `cf d1 migrations apply 4fa5c576-d2e6-4c73-9006-76505724bf36 --dir migrations`.
- **Not changed yet:** the relay's generic E2EE notification title is still
  "Whip" (`notify-relay/src/index.ts`).
